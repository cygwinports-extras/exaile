ldesc: "Exaile is a music player aiming to be similar to KDE's Amarok, 
but for GTK+ and written in Python. It incorporates many of the cool 
things from Amarok (and other media players) like automatic fetching of 
album art, handling of large libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album 
information via Wikipedia, Last.fm submission support, and optional iPod 
support via a plugin."
